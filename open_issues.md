## Todo

- Make firing on empty tiles destroy resources, etc.
- Move player to adjacent tile before exploring a new tile
- Apply gradient to battle text, or other method of showing bottom-to-top output
- Add a bunch more variety to battle text
- Improve battle intro animations (sliding panels)
- Add enemy and player attack animations, flying damage numbers
- Add additional enemy behavior
- Tune difficulty and combat numbers to account for map layer and resource pickup

## Bugs

- Combat text is cut off at the bottom for lines that almost fit when font size
is 60.
