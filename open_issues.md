# Open Issues

## Currently working

Implementing battles.

## Todo

- Implement battles
- Make firing on marked targets do damage, etc.
- Make firing on empty tiles destroy resources, etc.
- Limit number of marked targets based on resources
- Move player to adjacent tile before exploring a new tile
- If in targeting mode, still allow player to move to explored/empty tiles. This
may involve editing the state machine so that once a tile is explored it is
guaranteed to have nothing else of interest in it.
- Apply gradient to battle text, or other method of showing bottom-to-top output
